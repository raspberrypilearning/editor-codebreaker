### Decode the message

The atbash cypher **encodes** a message using the reverse letters of the alphabet. This means that exactly the same code can be used to **decode** the message. You can test this by taking your encoded message, copying and pasting it into your `input.txt` file and running the code again. 

--- task ---

**Run** your code so that it displays your encoded message. **Select** the encoded message and copy it. Go back to `input.txt` and delete your message. Next, **paste** your new message into the empty file. 

Remember that your code converts any text to lower case, so you will see your message in lower-case letters.

title: Copying and pasting
---

You can copy text and paste a copy in another place.

 1. Select the text you want to copy by dragging your mouse over it while holding down the left button.
 2. Copy the text by using your browser's menu — choose **Edit** > **Copy**. You can also use a keyboard shortcut — <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> on Windows or Linux systems, or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> on a Mac.
 3. Move your text cursor (the flashing line that shows where you are typing) to where you want to place a copy of the text.
 4. Paste the text by using your browser's menu — choose **Edit** > **Paste**. You can also use a keyboard shortcut — <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> on Windows or Linux systems, or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> on a Mac.

**Test:** Run your code again and press 'c' when prompted. It will display the **decoded** version of your original message.

**Debug:** It still displays the encoded message:
- Make sure that you have copy and pasted the **encoded** message into `input.txt`

In the next step you will write the code to **analyse the frequency** of letters in your text file.

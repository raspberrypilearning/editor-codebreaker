You need to create a new list that holds the alphabet, but backwards. You can use the `list()` function again to help with this. You can also use the `reversed()` function to reverse an existing list. 

--- task ---

Find the `# Create the atbash code by reversing the alphabet` comment then **define** a new function called `create_code`. Next, create a **list** that holds the **reverse** of the `alphabet` list. 

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - create_code()
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 10 
line_highlights: 11-12
---
# Create the atbash code by reversing the alphabet
def create_code():
    backwards = list(reversed(alphabet))  # Reverses a list

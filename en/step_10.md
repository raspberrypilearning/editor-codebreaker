Test the code by decoding the secret message
--- /task ---

The atbash cypher encodes a message using the reverse letters of the alphabet. This means that exactly the same code can be used to decode the message. You can test this by taking your encoded message, copying and pasting it into your input.txt file and running the code again.

**Run** your code so that it displays your encoded message. 

**Select** the encoded message and copy it. 

In `input.txt` delete your message. Next, **paste** your new message into the empty file.

### Tip
You can copy and paste into another place such as an empty word doc.

**Test:** Run your code and press 'c' when prompted. It will display the **decoded** version of your original message.

### Debugging
If it still displays the encoded message, make sure that you have copy and pasted the **encoded** message into `input.txt`

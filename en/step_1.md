<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">What you will make</h2>
--- task ---
In this project you will turn a message into a secret message, then use a graph to work out how to read it.
--- /task ---

You will encode or decode a secret message from a .txt file. Letter data can be displayed in a frequency graph, which shows how often each letter appears in the secret message.

**Run** the program twice to explore how it works:

First, choose ‘c’ to decode a message stored in an attached .txt file
Then, run the program a second time and choose ‘f’ at the prompt; this will display a letter frequency graph for the message.

### Tip
The <span style="color: #0faeb0">Atbash</span> cypher is one of the world's oldest known cyphers (a cypher is a secret or disguised way of writing). Originally developed in the <span style="color: #0faeb0">Hebrew</span> language, it takes the alphabet and matches it to its reverse order to create a secret message. The name derives from the first, last, second, and second-last Hebrew letters: <span style="color: #0faeb0">Aleph, Taw, Bet,</span> and <span style="color: #0faeb0">Shin

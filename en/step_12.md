Change the starting letter of the alphabet to create a different cypher. You can do this by changing the original `alphabet` list.

Add another language to your frequency analysis. You will need to investigate the frequency of letters used and place them into a dictionary in the `frequency.py` program. 

--- /task ---

Add another menu item to allow users to change the language.
